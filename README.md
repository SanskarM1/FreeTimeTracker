# FreeTimeTracker
The Free Time Tracker stands as a comprehensive full-stack project, leveraging SQLite3 and Python for the backend, coupled with Vue.js for the frontend. It allows users to log their daily activities, storing the data in a database. The system's versatility allows users to retrieve information through API calls, which are purposed with providing insightful visualizations of users' time allocations directly on the website.

# Project Scope
Created for the Independent Study and Mentorship Program in 2021-2022, this project aimed for a sophisticated implementation of code capable of uncovering subtle data patterns. However, due to the lack of experience on my end, much of the project time was spent learning the basics of backend development in SQL and Python, while also adventuring into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

# Learning
Marking my inaugural venture into full-stack development, the Free Time Tracker was pivotal in bridging the gap between isolated console programs and real-world applications. While the complete implementation of the project remained a work in progress, the journey itself was a rich learning experience. The knowledge gained not only expanded my skill set but also became the springboard for the development practices I employ today.
